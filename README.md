# MapUp - Analytics Dashboard Assessment

## Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the current electric vehicle landscape. It highlights key metrics, such as the average electric range, the continuously growing number of electric vehicles, and the distribution by vehicle type. A detailed analytics section offers deeper insights, allowing users to compare electric ranges, examine base MSRP values, and analyze the geographical distribution of electric vehicles by county.
